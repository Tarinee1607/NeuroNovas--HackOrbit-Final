**Check Point-1 : Language Detection and Translation **
    ### üåê Language Detection & Translation Support

    Our chatbot enhances inclusivity by incorporating automatic language detection and bidirectional translation, allowing users to communicate in their native language while receiving intelligent responses.
    
    ### üîç How It Works

    1. **Language Detection**: The system uses `googletrans` to identify the user's language. If it's not English, the message is translated into English for processing.
  
    2. **English-First Processing**: The translated message goes through our NLP pipeline for classification, emotion detection, and AI response generation using the Mistral API.

    3. **Response Translation**: The English response is translated back into the user's original language.

    4. **Fallback Logic**: If language detection fails, the system defaults to English.
